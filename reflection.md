# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?

In my initial UML design, I included four main classes: Owner, Pet, Task, and Planner. The Owner class was responsible for holding user information and a list of their pets. The Pet class stored details about each pet. The Task class represented individual care tasks, and the Planner class managed the scheduling of tasks. Initially, the relationships were simple: Owner had pets, Planner had tasks, and there was no explicit link between tasks and pets or between Planner and Owner.

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.

During implementation, I realized the need for stronger relationships between the classes. I updated the Task class to reference the specific Pet it belongs to, and I made the Planner class aware of both the Owner and their Pets, not just a list of tasks. I also added methods for managing pets in Owner and for managing tasks in Planner. These changes were made to better support multi-pet owners and to ensure the scheduling logic could access all the information it needs to generate accurate plans.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?
